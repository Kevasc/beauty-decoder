# Beauty Decoder

As someone who loves beauty products, I know how tricky it can be to find something that matches your ingredient preferences and allergy concerns. That’s why I created Beauty Decoder, a simple, easy-to-use website to help you discover products that fit your needs.
I came across the [Makeup API](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/), and while it’s not the most up-to-date, its a great starting point for testing this idea.


## Features

- Easily sort products by allergens, ingredients, and preferences across different catergories
- Up to date information using Luxon, showing when a product was created and when the data was last updated
- Buy button linked to official product pages to buy directly from the source
- Keep track of products you love with a personal like list
- Most products include swatches with a handy tooltip displaying the exact shade & name
