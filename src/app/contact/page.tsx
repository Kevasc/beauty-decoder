        Hi, I&apos;m Jordan! <br />
        <br />
        As a beauty enthusiast, I understand how important it is to find
        products that align with specific ingredient concerns and allergen
        sensitivities. <br />
        Thatâ€™s why I created a website that allows users to filter beauty
        products based on their unique needs. I discovered the {""}
        <a
          href="https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          className=" underline"
        >
          Makeup API
        </a>
        , which, while not the most up-to-date, serves as a great starting point
        for testing this concept in a real-world setting.
        <br /> My goal is to build a user-friendly platform that makes it easier
        for people to discover beauty products that truly work for them. <br />
        <br /> If you have any thoughts or feedback, I&apos;d love to hear them!
        <br /> You can connect with me on LinkedIn, and if you&apos;re
        interested in seeing how I brought this project to life, check out my
        GitHub.
